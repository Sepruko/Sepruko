# 🐈‍⬛ `Nat`

I'm a hobby developer of 6+ years, and I love writing code using a variety of
programming languages. Strongly-typed languages are my favorite.

## About Me

Hey there, I'm Sepruko! However, I prefer being called Nat. I enjoy writing
code, and it's something I try to do everyday (even if it's just a little bit).
I don't really have a favorite area, web-development to low-level, they're all
enjoyable.

> Something I enjoyed learning whilst dabbling in 3D software, was quaternions,
> as well as implementing them using Lua.

As for my preferred language? It's probably [Zig][zig].
