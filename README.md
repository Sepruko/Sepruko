favourite.

## About Me

Hello there, I'm Sepruko, but my preferred name is Nat. I love to write (good) code, whether it be
web-development with TypeScript and SCSS, or consuming APIs using a language like Go.

I enjoy challenging myself by trying new things and looking up anything I don't know in order to
gain an understanding. A good example would be quaternions, of which I knew nothing, but they
reignited my love for mathematics.

[Zig][zig-website] has been an invaluable asset in learning about how memory is stored, as
well as manual memory management.

## Experience

### Programming & Markup Languages

Programming and markup languages, some of which I have upwards of 5 years experience in using. I
know from an industry standpoint that 5 years isn't much, but I'm only 19 here. ðŸ˜›

- I'm very confident with languages including `Markdown`, `Lua`, `Luau`, `TypeScript`, `CSS`, `Go`,
  `HTML` and `JavaScript`.
- I much prefer `Luau` over `Lua 5.1`, `TypeScript` over `JavaScript`, `Kotlin` over `Java` and `Sass` over `CSS`.
- Excited to get more into `#C` once Native AOT and `.NET 7` get off the ground.

### Frameworks & Tooling

Frameworks and tooling to aid in the development of software.

> **Note**
> This list includes version control systems and build tools not included with a language (e.g.
> `Gradle`).

### Software

Communication, graphics and integration development environment software I am experienced with.
