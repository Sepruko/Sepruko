## About Me

I'm Sepruko, but you may call me Nat (this of course, is not my legal name). I love to program,
whether it be web-development with HTML, CSS & JavaScript, or font-end/back-end with languages like
Go, Zig and more.

I love to challenge myself by trying to new things, or seeing if I can recreate something awesome on
my own! With that being said, I'm not afraid to consult the documentation or perform other research tasks to learn more about the technology I'm using.

> *"I think that CSS and JavaScript allow for the developer to really think outside the box, do
> something crazy, and if it doesn't work? Try something else, or simply do what already works."*

Working with memory directly with languages like [Zig][zig-website] has taught me some incredibly important concepts and I've learned so much from this language alone. If it weren't for Zig
providing a far easier experience in dealing with these concepts, as well as a standard build-system
and library I would have been very unlikely to experiment with low-level programming for quite some
time.

## Work & Life

- Currently looking for employment in the technology industry.
  - Australia, **not** willing to move internationally.
  - Remote-only is preferred, moving domestically would still be a challenge for me both mentally
    and financially.
- My day-to-day life consists of...
  - Participating in the community, such as officiating local leagues for football (soccer).
  - Working on my own projects, such as [Gophigure][gh-gophigure].
    - This project includes both a Discord bot, and a framework empowering developers to build applications integrated with the Discord platform.
