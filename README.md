### Projects

#### Finished

- Nothing yet... Maybe try again later?

#### In Progress

- Glyde, a Go module for interacting with both the Discord API and Gateway.
- Gophigure, a Discord bot providing fast, fun, and easy utilities.

#### Ideas

- A new alternative, or competitor to [LumaTeam/Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS)
  - Don't get me wrong, Luma3DS is awesome and makes using unsigned content, or content from other regions as easy as pie, but it sounds like a lot of fun to write something complex and as low level as that for the 3DS family of consoles.
