## About Me

I'm Sepruko, but you may call me Nat (this of course, is not my legal name). I love to program,
whether it be web-development with HTML, CSS & JavaScript, or font-end/back-end with languages like
Go, Zig and more.

I love to challenge myself by trying to new things, or seeing if I can recreate something awesome on
my own! With that being said, I'm not afraid to consult the documentation or perform other research tasks to learn more about the technology I'm using.

> *"I think that CSS and JavaScript allow for the developer to really think outside the box, do
> something crazy, and if it doesn't work? Try something else, or simply do what already works."*

Working with memory directly with languages like [Zig][zig-website] has taught me some incredibly important concepts and I've learned so much from this language alone. If it weren't for Zig
providing a far easier experience in dealing with these concepts, as well as a standard build-system
and library I would have been very unlikely to experiment with low-level programming for quite some
time.

## Work & Life

- Currently looking for employment in the technology industry...
  - I am positioned in Australia, and I am **not** willing to move internationally,
  - and remote-only is preferred, moving domestically would still be a challenge for me financially.

- My day-to-day life consists of...
  - completing a vocational education course for a **Cert IV** in Information Technology,
    - I will be looking to work towards both a **Diploma**, and then a **Bachelors** in the same
      area.

  - participating in the community, such as officiating local leagues for football (soccer),
  - watching and reading programming content, so that I can better my knowledge of both existing and 
    emerging technologies,
  - and working on my own projects, such as [Gophigure][gh-gophigure].
    - This project includes both a Discord bot, and a framework empowering developers to build applications integrated with the Discord platform.

    </a>

- Playing video-games and consuming video content related to them...
  - some of my favorite games to play are Minecraft, Terraria & Overwatch 2,
  - I also enjoy playing Pok√©mon, especially "hacked" ROMs that have a lot of awesome and hard work
    put into them,
  - and I also have some really cool consoles, such as an `XBOX`, an `XBOX 360 Slim`,
    a `Nintendo DS Lite`, a `Nintendo 2DS`, a `New Nintendo 3DS XL` and a `Nintendo Switch`. 

## Programming & Markup Languages

Programming and markup languages I have experience with, some of which I have been using for upwards
of 4 years.

/>

---

- Very confident with languages such as `Go`, `JavaScript`, `(S)CSS`, `HTML` and `Markdown`.
    > *Yes*, I am aware not all of these are "programming" languages but they are either useful for
    > write-ups and documentation, or web-development. 
- I enjoy working with Zig (when it decides to work with me, too), which has taught me a lot about 
  low-level programming.
  - I am nothing if not incredibly excited about the recent
    [`0.10.0`](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/releases/0.10.0) release! üéâ
- May begin working more with C# once Native AOT (.NET 7) really takes off.
